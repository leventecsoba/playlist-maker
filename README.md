PlaylistMaker is a Web UI for converting users' local music folders into Spotify playlists using the Django framework and spotipy library.

Users can select song from their computer and PlaylistMaker searches Spotify for each song, which users they are able to add to a selected playlist of theirs.

PlaylistMaker is a basic portfolio project for the Django framework, and is still under development so it uses all main features of Django.
