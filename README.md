PlaylistMaker is a Web UI for converting users' local music folders into Spotify playlists using the Django framework and spotipy library.

Users can select songs from their device and PlaylistMaker searches Spotify for each song, which users are then able to add to a selected playlist of theirs.

PlaylistMaker is a super basic portfolio project for the Django framework.
